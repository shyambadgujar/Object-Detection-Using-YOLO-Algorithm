<h1>Description</h1>
<p>In an increasingly digital world, the need for efficient and reliable identification systems is
 paramount. Traditional methods of manual identification are not only time-consuming but
 also prone to errors. With the advancement of computer vision technologies, automated
 identification systems have become a promising solution.One such technology is YOLOv8,
 an object detection algorithm renowned for its accuracy and speed. YOLO, which stands for
 "You Only Look Once," is a deep learning-based approach that can detect objects in images
 or videos with remarkable efficiency. YOLOv8 represents the latest iteration of this model,
 incorporating improvements in both performance and accuracy.This project aims to
 leverage the power of YOLOv8 for the detection and recognition of identification cards (ID
 cards) in images. The ability to automatically identify and extract information from ID cards
 has numerous applications across various industries, including security, access control, and
 identity verification.By implementing YOLOv8 for ID card detection, we seek to develop a
 robust and scalable solution that can accurately locate and extract relevant information
 from ID cards in real-time. This system will not only streamline identification processes but
 also enhance security measures by automating the verification process and reducing the
 risk of human error.In this paper, we present the methodology and implementation details
 of our ID card detection system using YOLOv8. We discuss the dataset used for training and
 evaluation, the network architecture of YOLOv8, and the optimization techniques employed
 to enhance detection performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our
 system through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods.</p>

<h1>Project Idea
</h1>
 <p>
 ID identification means to recognize and pull out data from identity documents such as
  
 driving licences, passports or ID cards. This increases accuracy and processing speed in
 handling the same by adopting YOLOv8 algorithm and thus using YOLO (You Only Look
 Once) algorithm for ID detection. The latest version of the YOLO series is YOLOv8 which is
 popular for its real-time object detection capabilities. The term ‘YOLO’ originated from ID
 detection with use of YOLOv8 involves finding and identifying objects particularly IDs
 among other things in images or videos using a highly developed deep learning model.
 YOLO stands for You Only Look Once which is an object detection system applying a single
 neural network to the full image thus making it both fast and efficient. The term ’YOLOv8’
 comes from blending the English word ’You Only Look At Once’ with 8 that signifies the
 recent advancement of this model called Yolo. This method involves real time image or
 frame processing to identify and classify objects with high precision
